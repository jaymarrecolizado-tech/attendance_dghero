# Multi-event All Father platform

Turn the app into a multi-event platform: All Father creates events, assigns people and roles per event, each event has unique register/scan links, current attendance capabilities stay.

**OpenCode + Muse Spark 13** on branch `attendance_accend`. Enforce [ponytail](https://github.com/dietrichgebert/ponytail) and [taste-skill](https://github.com/leonxlnx/taste-skill) (`design-taste-frontend` + `redesign-existing-projects`).

**Status:** Implemented. Do not rebuild EventContext or the multi-event model.

**Audit:** 2026-09-14 (third pass). Leftovers 1, 2, and 4 were already in `a7755d1`. Leftover 3 is complete after wiring [`ResolvesEventContext`](src/Controllers/Concerns/ResolvesEventContext.php) on Import (was imported but not `use`d) and the export page.

## Agent: start here

There is **no remaining Plan.md leftover list**. Pull `attendance_accend` and keep changes additive.

**Session contract**

1. Branch is `attendance_accend`.
2. Load ponytail (`full`) and taste-skill. Skills live in [`.agents/skills/`](.agents/skills/).
3. Design read before CSS/view changes: public-sector, trust-first. Tokens are already Public Sans + federal navy in [`assets/app.css`](assets/app.css). Do not revert to Inter or `#5c6cf2`.
4. Reuse `EventContext`, `AuthService`, `ResolvesEventContext`, and `?r=` routes.
5. Do not commit `.env`, `.env.vps`, `storage/` uploads, `graphify-out/cache`, or extra skill copies under `.claude/skills/` or `agent/`.

```bash
git checkout attendance_accend
git pull origin attendance_accend
php scripts/test_rbac_matrix.php
```

## Checklist

- [x] Branch `attendance_accend` created and pushed
- [x] Multi-event draft (`c619ef0`) + finish commit (`3d1ec25`) + leftover close (`a7755d1`)
- [x] Ponytail in [`opencode.json`](opencode.json); taste-skill in [`.agents/skills/`](.agents/skills/) + [`skills-lock.json`](skills-lock.json)
- [x] `009` + `010` migrations, [`EventContext`](src/Services/EventContext.php), backfill
- [x] Unique links `e=slug`, public picker, All Father copy buttons
- [x] `event_admin` links page [`admin_event_links`](views/admin_event_links.php)
- [x] Event switcher + scoped registrants/attendance/import/export/report/gallery/SEO
- [x] Schedule window in `isPublicOpen()` (status + `starts_at` / `ends_at`)
- [x] Event Save keeps schedule fields
- [x] Router `event:` guard fails closed
- [x] Participant lookup requires `e` (or kiosk `scan_event_id`)
- [x] Controller tests: `event_admin` matrix, cross-event submit, lookup without `e`, schedule window, hard-deny forced context
- [x] SEO and attendance queries scoped with `event_id = ?` only (no `IS NULL` bleed)
- [x] Taste restyle: Public Sans + federal navy (`#1a4480` / `#162e51`), flat surfaces, solid navbar
- [x] One auth helper [`ResolvesEventContext`](src/Controllers/Concerns/ResolvesEventContext.php) on event-scoped admin controllers, including Import (`use` the trait) and export page
- [x] Hard-deny: `currentEvent()` returns null for an unassigned session event (no silent remap)
